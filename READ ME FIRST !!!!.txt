# CONTACT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The Contact Management System project I have developed is a Python-based software that provides a simple and intuitive 
graphical user interface (GUI) for managing contact information. The project consists of a Python script called index.py, 
which serves as the main program.

The purpose of creating this software is to offer users an easy-to-use solution for organizing their contact lists. 
The system incorporates essential functionalities, including adding, viewing, deleting, and updating contact details. 
When adding a contact, the user is required to provide information such as the person's first name, last name, gender, 
address, and contact details.

To update a contact, the user can double-click on a record within the contact list, enabling them to edit the specific 
details. The system displays the contact details in a list view, providing a convenient overview of the stored information.
 Additionally, users have the option to delete any contact details they no longer require.

This GUI-based Contact Management System emphasizes the fundamental operations of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD). 
To ensure the persistence of user data, the project utilizes an external database connection file. By saving the data in a 
database, users can retain their contact information across multiple sessions.

To run this project, it is necessary to have Python installed on the user's computer. The Contact Management System is 
designed with simplicity in mind, making it suitable for beginners who are new to software development.

Overall, this software provides a user-friendly interface for managing contact information efficiently. 
Users can easily add, view, update, and delete contacts, enhancing their ability to organize and maintain their 
contact lists effectively.

# Development Environment

The software was primarily developed using the Python programming language. Python is known for its simplicity, 
readability, and extensive library support, making it suitable for rapid application development.

I utilized an IDE to write and manage the Python code efficiently. Popular choices for Python development include PyCharm, 
Visual Studio Code, and Atom. The specific IDE used may vary based on personal preference.

Depending on the database management system selected, I used specific Python libraries to establish a connection and interact with the database. For example, if SQLite was used, the sqlite3 module in Python's standard library provides the necessary functionality.
Other libraries like pymysql, psycopg2, or firebase-admin may be employed for other database systems.
